# Overview

This project is a simple Todo List application built using Flutter for the frontend and Java for the backend server. The app allows users to view, add, and manage tasks, with task data fetched from a remote server. The app and server communicate over a network socket to exchange task data in JSON format.

# Features

- Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks by entering the task title in a dialog box.
- Display Tasks: Tasks are fetched from a backend server and displayed in two categories: pending tasks and completed tasks.
- Mark Tasks as Done: Users can mark tasks as completed, moving them to the "Done Tasks" section.
- Remove Tasks: Both pending and completed tasks can be removed.
